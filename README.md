Reolens is a native app for watching your Reolink cameras. SwiftUI,
Swift 6, AVFoundation / VideoToolbox — no Electron, no Java, no
QtWebEngine. Cold launches in under a second; feels like every other
native Apple app on each platform.

It runs entirely on your devices. No Reolens server, no third-party
analytics, no telemetry, no accounts.

> The footage in marketing screenshots is procedurally rendered (a
> small Swift script generates "stock" camera scenes) rather than
> real captures — privacy-clean, license-clean, and still
> representative of what the app looks like in use.

## Install

### macOS — Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew tap jestatsio/reolens
brew install --cask reolens
```

Updates are handled by Sparkle inside the app — no `brew upgrade` needed.

### macOS — Direct download

Grab the signed, notarized DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/jestatsio/reolens/releases/latest):

```
https://github.com/jestatsio/reolens/releases/latest/download/Reolens.dmg
```

Drag **Reolens.app** to your Applications folder and launch.

### iPad / iPhone — TestFlight

```
https://testflight.apple.com/join/2Pk2Anfz
```

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jestatsio/reolens.git
cd reolens
./Scripts/build-app.sh run      # macOS — builds + signs + launches
cd AppiOS && xcodegen generate  # iOS — then open in Xcode 26
```

Requires Xcode 26 + Swift 6.2.

## Quick start

1. **Launch Reolens.** It asks for Local Network permission (needed to
   reach your cameras) and Notification permission (for motion alerts).
2. **Click the + in the sidebar** to add a camera. Enter the IP address
   (or hostname), username, and password — the rest is auto-detected.
3. **Pick a camera in the sidebar** to view it. Use the layout picker
   in the toolbar to switch between adaptive / spotlight / 2×2 / 3×3 /
   4×4 grids.

Drag tiles to rearrange them. Right-click a tile for "Make primary",
"Rotate", and per-channel settings.

## Remote access (off-LAN)

Reolens is LAN-only by design. It reaches your camera at its LAN IP
and does not exchange anything with Reolink's cloud, a DDNS provider,
or any third-party relay. To make a LAN-only app reachable when
you're away from home, put your phone *on* the LAN with an overlay
network. **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** is the
recommended path — it's free for personal use, takes about ten minutes
to set up, and avoids every footgun of port forwarding (open ports,
WAN-IP exposure, CGNAT'd ISPs, untrusted DDNS providers).

See **[docs/remote-connectivity.md](docs/remote-connectivity.md)** for
the full step-by-step. The short version:

1. **Install Tailscale on something always-on inside your LAN** —
   an Apple TV (the sleeper-pick: zero extra hardware in an Apple
   household), a UniFi / OPNsense / pfSense / OpenWrt router with
   the native Tailscale plugin, a Synology / QNAP NAS, or a Raspberry
   Pi. Enable **subnet routing** so it advertises your LAN's CIDR
   (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`).
2. **Approve the route** in the Tailscale admin console.
3. **Install Tailscale on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac**, sign in with
   the same account.
4. **Open Reolens off-LAN** — your phone reaches the hub at its LAN
   IP exactly as it does at home. No setting to change in Reolens.

Why an overlay network instead of DDNS: zero ports forwarded, nothing
on the public internet to scan, works on CGNAT'd connections, no
trust delegated to a free DDNS provider, family members reach the
cameras by inviting them to your tailnet.

## What you get

### Live viewing
- **Multi-camera grids** with adaptive layout, spotlight, and fixed 2×2
  → 5×5 presets. Drag-and-drop reorder. Per-camera rotation.
- **Hardware-decoded RTSP** (H.264 / H.265) via VideoToolbox. FLV / JPEG
  fallback when the stream renegotiates.
- **Picture-in-Picture, pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan** on iOS / iPadOS.
- **Two-way talkback** on supported cameras.
- **Full PTZ** — all 17 ops (pan / tilt / zoom / focus / presets /
  patrols) from a dedicated control bar.
- **Battery cameras** wake on the first tap; the single-camera detail
  view auto-wakes on appear so you don't tap twice.

### Recordings
- **Per-camera Recordings tab** with a day-density calendar, a per-day
  timeline strip with AI-event ticks, and a player that scrubs with a
  thumbnail rail.
- **All Recordings** view that fans across every channel — and across
  hubs — into one chronological feed. Filter by AI tag or by camera.
- **Cross-day natural-language search** ("packages this week",
  "vehicles yesterday at the driveway"). Runs through Apple's on-device
  `FoundationModels` when available (no recording data crosses the
  model boundary — just the prompt); otherwise a deterministic regex
  parser.
- **Bookmarks** — long-press / right-click / swipe to bookmark without
  playing. The clip downloads in the background so it's available
  offline; Wi-Fi by default, cellular toggle in Settings.

### Notifications
- **Rich motion / AI notifications** with the trigger frame, not just
  text. Tap to jump straight to the clip.
- **CloudKit-relayed background pushes** to iOS / iPadOS — events ride
  through *your own* iCloud private database, no Reolens server.
- **Per-camera mute** (default on, iCloud-synced) and **per-AI-tag
  filters**. **Notification diagnostics** screen + a 1,000-record
  rolling **notification log** so silent-push issues are self-
  diagnosing. **Overnight digest** — local notification at a user-
  configurable hour summarizing the previous day's events.

### Schedules
- **Recording schedule editor** — visual 7×24 weekly grid of when each
  camera writes to storage. Reads / writes via Reolink's `Rec` CGI
  command; degrades to read-only on firmware that doesn't expose it.
- **Motion-detection schedule** with **per-AI-tag overrides** — set
  the channel-level "when can alarms fire" window, then override per
  tag (e.g. quiet `vehicle` overnight while still alerting on
  `people`).
- **Motion privacy zones** — draw rectangles on the live frame;
  written back via `SetMask` with graceful local-only fallback.

### Platform polish
- **Stage Manager / multi-window** on iPad + macOS. "Open in New
  Window" on any camera row.
- **Home Screen / Lock Screen / Control Center widgets** on iOS /
  iPadOS; desktop widgets on macOS.
- **Live Activities + Dynamic Island** on iOS for in-flight motion
  events. Hub-grouped — multiple events on the same hub merge into
  one Live Activity rather than stacking.
- **HomeKit bridge scaffolding** on iOS / iPadOS (added in 0.6.0). The
  per-camera "Expose to HomeKit" toggle syncs through iCloud so flipping
  it on one device propagates to the device that has the entitlement.
  Full HomeKit Secure Video recording tier ships once Apple completes
  MFi certification — see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
- **Liquid Glass throughout** — toolbars, sidebars, chips, badges,
  popovers, sheets, HUDs all use the iOS 26 / macOS 26
  `.glassEffect()` material via centralized design tokens.
- **iCloud sync** — camera list, grid layout, channel order, and
  rotations sync across your Apple devices. Passwords stay per-
  device in Keychain by default; optional iCloud Keychain sync is in
  Settings.
- **Shortcuts & Siri** — "Hey Siri, open the Front Door camera in
  Reolens." Three App Intents: Open Camera, Show Today's Events,
  Mute Camera Notifications.
- **Auto-updates** — Sparkle in-app on macOS, TestFlight on iOS.

For the full feature surface and the per-release history, see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## System requirements

- **macOS 26 Tahoe or later** on Apple Silicon or Intel
- **iPadOS 26 / iOS 26 or later** on any device that runs them
- **A Reolink camera, NVR, or Home Hub** reachable on the local network
- **HTTP / HTTPS access** to the device's CGI port (default 80 / 443)

Users on macOS 14 / iOS 18 should stay on the 0.4.x security-backport
track. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). FoundationModels-driven
features (the Today digest, NL search) fall back to deterministic
implementations on devices without Apple Intelligence.

## Privacy

Reolens runs entirely on your devices. The network surface is:

- Your Reolink cameras, NVRs, and Home Hubs (over the local network)
- iCloud Drive — syncs your camera list across *your own* Apple devices
- iCloud CloudKit — relays motion-event pushes between your devices
  (private database, never touches Apple's public surface)
- `reolens.io/appcast.xml` (macOS only, for Sparkle update checks; can
  be disabled in Settings)
- Apple's TestFlight / App Store (iOS, for app updates)

That's it. No third-party analytics. No remote crash reporting. No
telemetry. No accounts.

**Credentials are device-local.** Camera passwords live in each
device's Keychain (`kSecAttrSynchronizable: false` — explicitly never
synced), and the iCloud Drive sync carries only metadata (display
name, host, port, username, grid layout). The full credential model
is documented in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) §3, §4.

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ App (SwiftUI views, @Observable state, ReolensApp / RootView)    │
│ AppiOS/ (iOS twin) + Widget extensions + Live Activity ext.      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AppShared (CameraStore split, RecordingsLoader, RecordingIndex,  │
│            PollManager, EventNotifier, RelayDiagnostics,         │
│            SharedContainer, ReolensGlass design tokens, …)       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ReolinkBaichuan (port 9000: talkback, alarm push, findAlarmVideo)│
│ ReolinkStreaming (RTSP + VideoToolbox + H.264 / H.265 + SDP)     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ReolinkAPI (CGI client, Commands, Codable models, StreamURLs)    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Dependency-only-downward. `ReolinkAPI` ships standalone — no UI deps,
testable in isolation. `AppShared` is the cross-platform behaviour
layer driving the macOS app, the iOS / iPadOS app, both widget
extensions, and the Live Activity extension.

Key concurrency primitives:

- `CGIClient` is an **actor** — one instance per camera. Reolink
  devices have a notoriously small global session cap, so the actor
  serializes login / refresh and reuses one token across all commands.
- `CameraSession` is `@MainActor`-isolated and `@Observable` — SwiftUI
  views observe its state directly.
- `RecordingsLoader` is an `@MainActor @Observable` class with a
  generation counter so a rapid date-flip never publishes stale
  results on top of the latest reload.
- `PollManager` owns the motion-event polling lifecycle separately
  from `CameraSession` with a depth-counted pause/resume primitive.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the engineering principles that gate
every change (platform parity by default, no telemetry, no
credentials in logs) and [AppiOS/README.md](AppiOS/README.md) for the
iOS-specific project layout.

### Release process

See [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for the full runbook. Short version:

1. Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in [App/Info.plist](App/Info.plist)
   and the matching `MARKETING_VERSION` in
   [AppiOS/project.yml](AppiOS/project.yml). The check-versions gate
   blocks PRs that drift.
2. Add a section to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
3. `git tag v0.6.0 && git push --tags`.
4. Watch [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)
   build, notarize, package the DMG, regenerate the appcast, and
   publish.
