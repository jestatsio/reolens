/// Cross-device motion-event relay. Added in 0.4.1 as the
/// foundation of iOS background notifications without violating
/// AGENTS.md §5 ("no servers"). Mechanism:
///
///   1. A `MotionEventPublisher` (only the macOS app implements one
///      today, via `CloudKitMotionEventPublisher`) writes a
///      `MotionEvent` `CKRecord` to the user's own private CloudKit
///      database whenever a Baichuan motion / AI event fires.
///   2. A `MotionEventSubscriber` (the iOS app) installs a
///      `CKQuerySubscription` on the same record type. CloudKit
///      delivers a silent push to every device signed into the same
///      iCloud account; the subscriber fetches the new record on
///      wake and posts a local `UNUserNotificationCenter`
///      notification.
///
/// Privacy: lives entirely inside the user's iCloud account
/// (private DB, never shared). Reolens has no server in the loop —
/// CloudKit's "our server" is Apple, under the user's own iCloud
/// credentials. AGENTS.md §5 is satisfied. The data we write is the
/// minimum needed to compose a useful notification on the receiving
/// device: a camera UUID, a channel index, a detection-type string,
/// a timestamp, and an optional snapshot JPEG attachment.

/// The data we relay per event. Sized to fit inside CloudKit's
/// free-tier silent-push payload (≤ 4 KB metadata; the snapshot
/// goes as a CKAsset, fetched on demand).
