/// `CameraStore` used to hold these directly, mixing UI prefs with
/// camera-list state and Keychain ops in a 775-LOC god object. This
/// type carves out the prefs slice so it can be tested in isolation
/// against a custom `UserDefaults` instance (no shared standard
/// pollution between test cases) and so future surfaces can read /
/// write prefs without depending on the whole CameraStore.
///
/// CameraStore embeds one of these and proxies its existing public
/// properties to the embedded instance — keeping the API stable so
/// the hundreds of callers across the app don't need to change.
